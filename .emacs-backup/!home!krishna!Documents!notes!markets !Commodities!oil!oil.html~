<li>Opec oil output cut brings relief to Saudi Arabia</li>
<li>fact is every Opec member needs cash now!”</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia’s new output ceiling of 10.06m barrels a day would knock 0.75 to 1 percentage points off overall gross domestic product, but this would be offset by an increase in government revenue.</li>
<li>allow the government to ease the pace of fiscal austerity</li>
<li>The price slide began in late 2014 as the US shale oil revolution soaked the world market. Riyadh responded by opening the taps to try to squeeze out the higher-cost upstarts, convinced they had the financial firepower to weather lower prices. But the price has fallen further — and for longer — than many in Riyadh ever imagined.</li>
<li><img src="./oil.org_20161201_205152_29498Ldq.png" alt="oil.org_20161201_205152_29498Ldq.png" /></li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Almost two-thirds of Saudis work for the state.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The hope in Riyadh is that the group’s production can be dialled back towards 32.5m b/d from around 33.2m b/d in August — enough, they believe, to start draining oil inventories next year</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia could end up shouldering a larger proportion of cuts</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>stumbling block was Iran’s determination to rev up production.</li>
<li>Iranian delegates upped their demands in Algiers, seeking an output target of 4.2m b/d, a level few believe they are even capable of producing.</li>
<li>hardball tactics paid off. Before the meeting Mr Falih first said that Iran’s history of sanctions meant it should “produce at the maximum levels that make sense”, alongside violence-hit members Nigeria and Libya.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>deal represents the recognition of their own impotence by a group of countries that once held unchallenged power.</li>
<li>This is not a deal capable of lifting prices to the level of $60 or $70 a barrel that is supposed to be Opec’s target.</li>
<li>stocks — which, according to the International Energy Agency and every other independent organisation that follows the oil market, will take at least a year (probably more) to run down.</li>
<li>If the Opec production cut were considered in isolation, this surplus might be expected to fall
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>But there is a surge of production coming in the next 12 months from new fields in countries outside Opec, such as Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>consider the US shale business</li>
<li>advances made in technology and productivity will spread across the world, further increasing output.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="text-warning">Too many of the promises</span></li>
<li>Opec has no enforcement mechanism against those who break the agreement.</li>
<li>To lift prices to anything close to $70 a barrel, Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia alone, will have to cut production dramatically — by another 1m to 1.5m b/d, and to hold it down at that level for a year or more.</li>
<li>Cartels need a swing producer that has the capacity to vary production to the degree necessary to control the market and which can absorb the pain of such a move.</li>
<li>That is what they would have done in the past, but it may now be impossible, economically and politically.</li>
<li>Saudi Arabia cannot sustain such a sacrifice</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Nigeria and Libya could present further complicating factors, delegates said. Nigeria's output hit its lowest in over two decades this year due to attacks on oil sites and Libya is pumping a fraction of the pre-conflict level - raising the question of what level they should limit supplies at.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>While Nigeria supported April's freeze initiative, Libya declined to join the talks.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>even Saudi Arabia itself has raised its output to record levels in July,</li>
<li>These increases arise as countries which usually do not join any global actions such as North American producers are expected to add more barrels.</li>
<li>The International Energy Agency expects non-OPEC output to rise by 300,000 bpd next year after a decline of 900,000 bpd in 2015 as North American output stabilizes.</li>
<li>Hence, persuading countries such as Iran, Iraq and Russia to return to output controls will be a difficult task for Riyadh but a worst option would be to raise expectations of a deal that doesn't happen, like in April.</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Given the fundamental imbalance of supply and demand and the accumulated stocks overhanging the market, a cut of at least 2m barrels a day would be necessary and crucially would have to be maintained for at least two to three years.</li>
<li>That might stabilise prices or produce a modest upturn, perhaps taking the price over $50. To reach $70 would require a much bigger cut in production, maintained for longer.</li>

<li><span class="text-danger">Would Russia stick to any agreement given its urgent financial needs?</span></li>
<li>US oil producers will not be party to any agreement reached in Algeria. A stronger price would provide the incentive needed to renew the growth of oil from shale rock in America, where producers have reduced costs dramatically over the last two years.</li>
<li>Some production is now shut in for economic reasons but could be restarted relatively quickly if the price signal was right. And several new areas of potential production are waiting to be developed.</li>
<li><span class="text-warning">The net effect</span></li>
<li>Opec members in urgent need of added revenue would find they had cut output and exports only to see others benefiting from the resulting price increase. In such circumstances, no deal would last long.</li>
<li><span class="text-success">reality is that oil supply has diversified over the last decade</span></li>
<li>The notion that a sustainable rise is imminent is built on sand. Oil is a global commodity and its price is now beyond the control of any single producer or group of producers.</li>
<li>It will only increase when the fundamentals of supply and demand shift and as yet we are nowhere near that point.</li>
<li>reality is that there seems to be a temporary equilibrium in the range of $40 to $50 a barrel.</li>
<li>price may be volatile in that range and responsive to rumours and speculation, but all the evidence of the last year is that the boundaries are pretty well set.</li>

<li>“The situation remains extremely fluid and there is still a high probability that production and exports do not rise at all, given Libya’s political complexity,”</li>
<li>They argued that Mr Haftar is still seeking greater power in the country and showing he could capture the terminals was a means of increasing his leverage, leaving them at risk if he is unsuccessful in extracting concessions from Tripoli.</li>

<h3 id="orgheadline69"><span class="section-number-3">12.2</span> The curious case of rising US oil imports</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>US abolished curbs on exporting crude oil in December, exports have been strong. But in a curious twist, US oil imports have risen too.</li>
<li>The “ships passing in the night”, in the words of one analyst, embody a complex new reality where the US is both an important supplier to the global oil market as well as its biggest consumer.</li>
<li>The primary reason for rising imports has been tapering US oil supply.</li>
<li>estimates production has fallen 1.2m b/d from a peak of 9.6m b/d in April 2015</li>
<li>The importance of imports was highlighted last week after a storm temporarily hobbled inbound cargoes, causing national oil inventories to sink by a surprising 14.5m barrels.</li>
<li>But if production is falling in the US, why would it export more? The answer is to do with the quality and location of different types of oil.</li>
<li>Many US refineries run best on the heavier variety, which also tends to be cheaper.</li>
<li>light oil from US shale formations,</li>
<li>S light crude was fenced in by a lack of pipelines and the export ban. Now it can flow fairly freely to refineries better equipped to handle it in places such as Canada and Europe.</li>
<li>The US refiners that were force-feeding their processing units with light domestic oil are now more likely to tap foreign, heavier types.</li>
<li>Location also matters. Some refineries on the US east coast still process lighter crudes. They built railroad yards to take train loads of oil from North Dakota’s Bakken shale, since no crude pipelines run to the east coast and domestic shipping rules inhibit the use of coastal vessels from Texas.</li>
<li>As Bakken output declined, the amount of crude shipped by rail plummeted and east-coast refineries turned to light oil imports from countries such as Nigeria.</li>
<li>shipments in both directions have been helped by low rates for hiring tankers.</li>
<li>Canada is the premier foreign supplier of crude to the US and the biggest customer for its exports. This dual status is possible because most imports arrive via pipeline from Alberta, while US exports mostly travel via tanker to refineries in Canada’s eastern provinces.</li>

<li>Projects with long lead times that began in the $100 a barrel era are joining the supply wave</li>
<li>For those who believe the oil market will eventually confront a supply crunch because of the unprecedented collapse in capital expenditure over the past two years the International Energy Agency’s investment report provides plenty of ammunition.</li>
<li>“There is evidence that cuts in exploration activities have already resulted in a dramatic decline in new oil discoveries, dropping to levels not seen in the last 60 years”</li>
<li>However, the eye-catching retrenchment is not the only story the report tells.</li>
<li>The current decline in spending follows a massive investment binge between 2011 and 2014, when oil prices held above $100 a barrel.</li>
<li>And the repercussions of that investment splurge are still being felt.</li>
<li>many are only now coming on stream</li>
<li>Opec, the production cartel, revised up its oil supply forecasts from non-member countries for this year and 2017.</li>
<li>it cited higher than expected output from Norway as well as the start-up of the long-delayed Kashagan field in Kazakhstan.</li>
<li>It found the developments in places such as the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, the North Sea and Russia will add 5.2m barrels a day of gross capacity to the market.</li>
<li>Of course, more capacity does not necessarily translate into more supply.</li>
<li>This is especially true for oil because new streams will be offset by falling production from more mature fields.</li>
<li>But even assuming an annual decline rate of 4.2 per cent</li>
<li>2.7m b/d of net supply to the market — a large chunk of it coming in the not too distant future.</li>
<li>If JBC has got its projections correct on the 99 projects, it means two things, neither of which is particularly bullish for oil. Inventories will probably continue to build next year. And the market could be even more oversupplied in the first half of 2017 than it was in the same period this year, when prices slumped below $30 a barrel to a 12-year low.</li>
<li>lut could get worse if two Opec crude producers whose supplies have been disrupted by internal conflicts — Nigeria and Libya</li>
<li>None of this is to say that the record decline in spending over the past two years will not have an impact over the longer term, especially if demand growth continues to average more than 1m b/d.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-12-4">

<li>is an offshore oil field in Kazakhstan's</li>
<li>located in the northern part of the Caspian Sea close</li>
<li>Kashagan Field has recoverable reserves of about 13 billion barrels</li>
<li>Harsh conditions, including sea ice during the winter, temperature variation from −35 to 40 °C (−31 to 104 °F), extremely shallow water and high levels of hydrogen sulfide, together with mismanagement and disputes, make it one of the most challenging oil megaprojects</li>
<li>main source of supply for the Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline</li>
<li>A stake in the field was acquired by the Chinese government in September</li>

<li>Kashagan oilfield in Kazakhstan, which has earned the unfortunate nickname “cash-all-gone” due to a series of expensive overruns, is now scheduled to finally start up in October</li>
<li>Opec,said Kashagan’s ramp up is one reason it now thinks supplies outside the group will actually grow next year, despite two years of low prices.</li>
<li>The field, first discovered in 2000, is one of the largest conventional finds in four decades, but its location in the northern part of the Caspian Sea has complicated the development</li>
<li>Kazakhstan’s state oil company and a consortium of some of the world’s biggest oil companies, including ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell.</li>
<li>It first began pumping in 2013 when it was already eight years over schedule, but quickly stopped due to a series of internal pipeline leaks.</li>
<li>it would pump around 100,000 b/d next year. That will mean this one field’s output will need to be watched closely next year, as the difference is almost equal to the production of war-damaged Libya.</li>
